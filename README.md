# FFC-Google-Translate
Inspired by Kin_Tamashii's "Book of Mario" series of videos, the code here hopes to similarly nonsensically translate "Fossil Fighters: Champions" for the Nintendo
DS. So far, there is only code to run through NPC dialogue, but move names and whatnot will be addressed at a later date.

Tools needed:
- Python and Java
- Fossil Fighters Tool 1.3+ (https://github.com/jianmingyong/Fossil-Fighters-Tool)
- jNDSTool (https://github.com/JackHack96/jNdstool)
- Argos Translation (https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate)
- The appropriate Argos packages (run packages.py to get them)
- The most recent version of NumPy (make sure to run ```pip install --upgrade NumPy``` to be safe)

A full write-up of the process will be provided when the translation is finished; you can probably figure it out from the code. Do be warned that creating this 
translation is **extremely** slow (well, at least on my mid-tier laptop).
