# FFC-Google-Translate
Inspired by Kin_Tamashii's "Book of Mario" series of videos, the code here hopes to similarly nonsensically translate "Fossil Fighters: Champions" for the Nintendo
DS. So far, there is only code to run through NPC dialogue, but move names and whatnot will be addressed at a later date.

Tools needed:
- Python and Java
- Fossil Fighters Tool 1.3+ (https://github.com/jianmingyong/Fossil-Fighters-Tool)
- jNDSTool (https://github.com/JackHack96/jNdstool)
- CrystalTile2 (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/)
- Argos Translation (https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate)
- The appropriate Argos packages (run packages.py to get them)
- The most recent version of NumPy (make sure to run ```pip install --upgrade NumPy``` to be safe)

To see how to set all this up, you can read Setup.txt. Be warned that this probably takes an actual server or something to run, I definitely would not advise using a
personal laptop or desktop computer after my experiences.
